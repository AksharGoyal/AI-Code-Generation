# AI-Code-Generation

The repo contains code I worked with during my time at the bootcamp.
The [notebook](https://github.com/AksharGoyal/AI-Code-Generation/blob/main/Akshar_LLM_Bootcamp.ipynb) was made as part of the final assessment needed to complete the bootcamp requirements.  
The following code is used to tune an LLM model and have it generate code based on prompts.  
Make sure to connect to a GPU before running.

The notebook [AI Code Generation](https://github.com/AksharGoyal/AI-Code-Generation/blob/main/code_generation.ipynb) is the one I am proud to show off.
I got to use my knowledge I gained from the bootcamp to make a ChatBot that answers your questions regarding coding and help you in boosting your productivity.
Hope you enjoy playing with it.
